# Analysis script for mass spectrometry data

To analyze the HPLC-MS data obtained from culture extracts of bacteria expressing chimeric *trans*-AT PKSs,
we used the here provided Python script.

Note that we used different respository branches of the script for the analysis of the data obtained from the different strains.
To reproduce these analysis, please checkout the various branches.
